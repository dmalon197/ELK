# ELK Project
This is a collection of Diagrams and Ansible Scripts from my CyberSecurity Boot Camp.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with differnt docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container
