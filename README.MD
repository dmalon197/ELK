Automated ELK Stack Deployment
The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

Note: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace diagram_filename.png with the name of your diagram image file.


These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

Description of the Topology
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application. Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network

Load Balancers protect against distributed denial of service attacks, and ensure availabilty. The advantage of a jump box is a provide restricted access to your network enviroment_.
Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the operating system and system services.

Filebeat monitors file logs, collects log events and forwards them for indexing.
Metricbeat records metrics and statistics from an operating system and services running on a server_.
The configuration details of each machine may be found below. Note: Use the Markdown Table Generator to add/remove values from the table.

Name	Function	IP Address	Operating System
Jump Box	Gateway	10.0.0.4	Linux
Web-1	DVWA Container	10.0.0.9 Linux
Web-2	DVWA Container	10.0.0.10	Linux
Web-3	DVWA Container	10.0.0.11	Linux
ELKvm	ELK/Kibana Server	10.1.0.4	Linux
Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:

204.145.147.105_
Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.

The Jump Box was allowed access the ELK VM? It's IP Address was 10.0.0.4_.
A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

Name	Publicly Accessible	Allowed IP Addresses
Jump Box	YES	204.145.147.105
Web-1	NO	10.0.0.4
Web-2	NO	10.0.0.4
Web-3	NO	10.0.0.4
ELKvm	YES	204.145.147.105
Elk Configuration
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...

The main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible, is that it allows IT administrators daily tasks to be automated. This frees up more time for them. Allowing them to focus on more importan tasks.
The playbook implements the following tasks:

Install Docker.
Create & Attach a container.
Create Filebeat on Web Vm's.
Create Filebeat configuration file.
Create Filebeat installation play.
Verify the installation & playbook.
The following screenshot displays the result of running docker ps after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

Note: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace docker_ps_output.png with the name of your screenshot image file.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output] 

Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

10.0.1.4
10.0.1.5
10.0.1.6
We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeats
These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

Filebeat monitors file logs, collects log events and forwards them for indexing. E.g auditd module collects and parses logs from the audit daemon
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

Copy the Ansible playbook file to /etc/ansible/files.
Update the filebeat.yml file to include name, image, state and ports.
Run the playbook, and navigate to the Filebeat installation page on the ELK server GUI to check that the installation worked as expected.
TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:

_Which file is the playbook? filebeat-playbook.yml Where do you copy it? /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? The hosts file. How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? By specifying the which host group that the various systems belong to
Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://20.75.51.63:5601/ .
As a Bonus, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc.
